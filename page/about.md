## Age 0 [1996] - Age 10 [2005] 

I was born in Butterworth, Malaysia, on 14 Nov 1996. Coming from an average family, I didn't have the luxury to enjoy much 'ART' things except drawing, which I suck at. As I didn't keep a journal, I didn't remember my childhood much, just to lay out some vivid images. I am staying at Kulim at first then later move to Simpang Ampat. Although I didn't have PC at young age, I do have access to console that is PS1 at age of 8 while live at Perai and PS2 at age of 10 while live at Alma. Many embarrassing things happened like try to get a girl's attention foolishly and having too much ego. <br>
我于1996年11月14日出生在马来西亚, 北海。出身于一个普通家庭的我，除了画画之外(画得蛮烂)，并没有享受到多少关于 "艺术 "的东西。由于我没有写日记，所以我对自己的童年没有太多的记忆，只能铺陈一些清晰的画面。我一开始住在居林，后来搬到新邦安拔。虽然我小时候没有电脑，但我有机会接触到游戏机，8岁住在北赖的时候有PS1，10岁住在阿儿玛的时候有PS2。我曾做过很多尴尬的事情，比如愚蠢地吸引女孩的注意和太过自负。

## Age 11 [2006] - Age 12[2007] : Life Changing Event 改变的契机

Back then, I was a rebel kid until one I made my mum cry. My family was quite religious; they believe that I am misbehaving because of the karma. So I need to repay it by becoming a short term monk. Leaving home and staying in an unfamiliar place alone for 12 days, I am becoming mature. The result is satisfactory; my temper is getting good. <br>
那时候我挺叛逆的，直到有一次我把妈妈弄哭了。我的家人相当虔诚，他们认为我行为不端是因为业力的缘故。所以我需要通过当一个短期的和尚来修福。离开家，独自在一个陌生的地方住了12天，我变得成熟了。结果很满意，我的脾气有所改善。

## Age 13 [2008] - Age 17 [2013] 

I temporarily settled down at Alma, which I stayed over 7 years and also passed the high school year. Good that I realize that I actually am not smart, so I have to counter it with hard work. The idea didn't go smoothly, not sure why I am addicted to Internet, which indirectly ruins my highschool time. Although I managed to get King Scout qualification which when I throwback, I shouldn't. Not a good achiever, my SPM result only 6A over 10 subjects. I wish I will take note of everything as I did now. Though I am not a good student by the standard, I assured I am a qualified son, brother, and friend. <br>
我暂时在阿尔玛安顿下来，我在这里呆了7年多，也过了高考。好在我意识到自己其实并不聪明，所以我必须用努力来应对。这个想法并不顺利，不知道为什么我沉迷于上网，这间接毁了我的高中时光。虽然我成功的拿到了国王的侦察兵资格，如果再来一次我不会参加了。我高考成绩不好，SPM10科只有6A。还好我现在已有该善，会把事情记下来。虽然我不是一个标准的好学生，但我相信我是个称职得儿子、兄长、朋友。

## Age 18 [2014] - Age 21 [2017] 
Life in the university is pretty standard; I didn't have much to say. Only if I know, I will study harder but whatever. It didn't matter like in high school, so it is okay for me. I have done web developer as an internship in 2016, for the first time I am doing web, didn't like it or hate it either. Then I thought to myself; I am quite weak at coding, might as well try a job not related to that. I am travelling alone for the first time in Japan in 2017. To my surprise, the expense is not really high as people told if you are not a big spender. The journey is pleasant, and trying to talk in Japanese certainly is a fun experience. <br>
大学里的生活很标准，我没有什么可说的。重来的话，我会更加努力的学习。大学成绩没有像高中那么重要，所以对我来说还可以。我在2016年实习的时候做过网络开发，这是我第一次做网络，不喜欢也不讨厌。后来我就想；我的编码能力挺弱的，不如试试与此无关的工作。2017年我第一次一个人去日本旅游。出乎我的意料，如果你不是大手大脚的话，费用其实并没有大家说的那么高。旅途算挺愉快，尝试用日语交谈当然是一种有趣的体验。

## Age 22 [2018] 

After graduating, while waiting to be called by my scholarship provider, I am travelling to Thailand with some friends， it was just an ordinary journey. quite unfortunate for that I didn't hear back from my scholarship provider, so I need to find a job to feed myself. Thinking to avoid coding job, I am going to find a job in Kuala Lumpur (KL). I am renting a room with a friend, which turns out to be a wrong decision due to lack of experience. Now I know, don't share a room and if you are not sure how long you're going to stay, might as well find a short-term rental. After spending 2 weeks, I got a technical support role in a marketing startup. For the 2 months, I missed coding so much, at least I can think with my brain. By the time I thought about quitting the job, my scholarship provider had contacted me to consider taking up one project for 2 years and get a Master Degree. This seems like an excellent escape route for me. This period really hit me hard, made a massive impact on my confidence and affected my mental health. In short, don't simply sign a contract on rental and Internet. <br>
毕业后，在等待奖学金提供者的通知期间，我和几个朋友一起去泰国旅游，这次旅行的体验算普通。挺不幸的，奖学金提供者没有回音，所以我需要找一份工作来养活自己。想着为了避免编程的工作，我准备在吉隆坡找一份工作。我和朋友一起租房，事实证明这是一个错误的决定。这样缺乏经验的决定让我知道了，不要合租一个房间，如果你不确定要住多久，不如找一个短期租房。花了2周时间，我在一家营销型创业公司找到了一个技术支持的职位。在这2个月里，我非常想念编码工作，至少我可以用大脑思考。当我想到辞职的时候，我的奖学金提供者已经联系了我，让我考虑接一个为期2年的项目，还可以拿一个硕士学位。这对我来说似乎是一条极好的逃避途径。这段时间对我的打击真的很大，对我的信心产生了巨大的影响，也影响了我的心理健康。总之，不要简单的签租房和上网的合同。

## Age 23 [2019] : Starting to be an Adult 开始作为一个成年人

Starting to live alone really makes learning fast and efficient. I learnt how to manage my wealth, how to fill out taxes, and the proper way to drive a car. Still having housemates is not a good living condition for me, I should have stayed alone in a unit when I can afford. The contract job is ok, but the Master Degree hit hard. My supervisor is the faculty dean, so he doesn't have time to guide me. I have to explore on my own. For the first 6 months, I got the topic wrong, managed to stir it to the right track though. Some point towards the mid of my Master Degree, I am thinking to continue this path to become a researcher. The research process is laborious and despairs; the pro is you have flexible time. For 2 months, I am not making progress due to burning out. By the end of the year, I only get the intuition of the literature review; I can confirm it is very crucial to do it properly. <br>
开始一个人生活真的让学习变得快速而高效。我学会了如何理财，如何填税，还有正确的开车方式。有舍友的生活条件对我来说不是很好，我应该在有能力的情况下，一个人住在单位。合同工还好，但硕士的打击很大。我的上司是学院院长，所以他没有时间指导我。我只能自己探索。前6个月，我把题目做错了，不过还是设法把它搅到了正确的轨道上。在硕士期间的某个时间点，我想继续走这条路，成为一名研究人员。研究过程很辛苦，也很绝望，优点是有弹性的时间。2个月来，我因为过劳而没有进展。到了年底，我才有了文献综述的直观感受；我可以确认，做好文献综述是非常关键的。

## Age 24 [2020] : COVID-19 pandemic 新冠病毒

I have considered completing my PhD oversea to experience a different culture. Before I leave, I have to make sure all my contract is gone (scholarship bonding, phone contract). Still, the loans are with me. There's an epidemic called COVID-19 happening, and the government has introduced a movement control order to control the spreading of the virus. <br>
我曾考虑过在海外完成博士学位以体验不同的文化。在我离开之前，我必须确保我所有的合同都没有了（奖学金担保，电话合同）。不过，贷款还是有的。今年发生了COVID-19的疫情，政府出了行动管制令以控制病毒的传播。

## Age 25 [2021] : current 现阶段

I began a job as a data scientist in a medical services company. I resigned after six-month of work to think about what I really want to d; luckily I manage to figure it out. I will pursue a career related to sustainable development. After many considerations, I have decided to do PhD in Malaysia. <br>
我开始在一家医疗服务公司做数据科学家的工作。工作半年后，我辞职了，思考自己到底想做什么。幸运的是我想好了，我将从事与可持续发展有关的工作。经过多方考虑，我决定待在马来西亚读博士。
